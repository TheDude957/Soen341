# INSTALLATION AND RUNNING PROCEDURE

The next points are the steps to follow in order to ensure a smooth experience with our web-application:

1- Download the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and use it as the development environment for this project.

2- Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Our team is using the version 16.14.0 LTS (the one recommended for most users).

3- Open this project in Visual Studio Code and open a new terminal.

4- In the new terminal, write the command "npm install" to install all the latest modules of the application.

5- Once the modules are all installed, write the command "npm start". This should open a window with the website in your Chrome browser.

6- To terminate your session, click in your terminal and press "Ctrl + C" for Windows users ("Cmd + C" for iOS users) and write "y" as an answer to the question "Terminate batch job (Y/N)?" 

# TESTS

Acceptance tests:

You can access the most up to date acceptance tests written for our application [here](https://github.com/TheDude957/team_name-soen341project2022/wiki/Acceptance-Tests-Sprint-3).



Run our client-side tests using [Playwrigt Inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector):
